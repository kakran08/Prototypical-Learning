# Prototypical learning
 1. Prototypical networks compute the average features of all
 samples available for each class in order to calculate a prototype
 for each class. 
 2. Classification of a given data point is then
 determined by its relative proximity to the prototypes for each
 class.
 3. Unlike matching networks, Prototypical networks use
 Euclidean distance rather than cosine distance.
 ## Omniglot

 from 50 alphabets. 
 
 There are 20 examples associated with each
 character, where each example is drawn by a different human
 subject.
## MiniImageNet
 It is derived from ILSVRC dataset. It is used to show examples
